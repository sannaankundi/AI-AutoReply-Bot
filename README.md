# AI-AutoReply-Bot
 
Alright so this is a chat bot for Whatsapp Desktop/Web. 

It's exclusively for that only. Bcz' the features and stuff that it does is too basic.

When run:
1. Selects all the chat history that is being shown on the screen in Whatsapp Web/Desktop.
2. Copies it and pastes it in the bot.py's special place
3. With your Open AI's API key(paid), you can analyze the chat history automatically and then give an AI-based human reply.

You can also change your whole character. I mean, the character that you want your bot to be like.

And that's it.

BTW, it keeps on doing all the stuff for you.
Analyzing and replying.
Then analyzing and replying.
Unless you forcibly stop it.
